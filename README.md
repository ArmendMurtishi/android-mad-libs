# android-mad-libs

A basic mad-lib Android layout designed for classroom use; teachers can provide students with an Android UI without having to yet introduce them to the complexities of Android development.  
  
For teaching purposes, this code provides an Android layout with cookie-cutter Android code and library-style code.  
With the library-style code, a very minimal amount of Android code must be seen by the student.
With the cookie-cutter code, students can see the Android code, but must fill in sections with their unique code.
